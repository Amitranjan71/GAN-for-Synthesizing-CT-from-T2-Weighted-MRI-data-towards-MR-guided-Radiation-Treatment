# GAN for Synthesizing CT from T2-Weighted MRI data towards MR-guided Radiation Treatment
 In medical domain, cross-modality image synthesis suffers from multiple issues such as context-misalignment, image distortion, image blurriness, and loss of details. The fundamental objective behind this study is to address these issues in estimating synthetic Computed tomography (sCT) scans from T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in order to achieve MRI-guided Radiation Treatment (RT).
